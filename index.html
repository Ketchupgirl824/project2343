    <h2>Wayside School</h2>
    <p>Wayside School is a series of short story cycle children's books written by Louis Sachar. Titles in the series include Sideways Stories from Wayside School (1978), Wayside School is Falling Down (1989), Wayside School Gets A Little Stranger (1995), and Wayside School Beneath the Cloud of Doom (2020).[1]. The books tell of a school where the contractor misread the blueprints and mistakenly built it sideways. As such the school was constructed as a 30-story skyscraper. The 19th floor was omitted from the plans. Each chapter in the books corresponds with a "floor" of the school.

        Sachar released two spinoff books of mathematics and puzzles interspersed with stories: Sideways Arithmetic from Wayside School (1989) and More Sideways Arithmetic from Wayside School (1994). Wayside: The Movie is a television special loosely based on the books that aired in 2005, and was followed-up by the Wayside animated series that originally ran from 2007 to 2008.</p>
